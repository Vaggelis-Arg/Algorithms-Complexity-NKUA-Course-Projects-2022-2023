# 🧠 Algorithms and Complexity – NKUA Course Projects (2022–2023)

This repository contains **four course projects** developed for the **"Algorithms and Complexity"** undergraduate course at the **Department of Informatics and Telecommunications**, **National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA)**.

I completed **Assignment 0 individually**, while **Assignments 1, 2, and 3** were completed in collaboration with my classmate and friend  **Pavlos Tomazos** ([Eruden](https://github.com/Eruden)).

The course focused on understanding algorithmic design principles, analyzing computational complexity, and applying techniques such as dynamic programming, recursion, greedy methods, and graph algorithms to solve real problems. While the course was taught in **Greek**, some project submissions (e.g., Assignment 0 and Assignment 3) are in **English**.
